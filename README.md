# The-Analysis-of-Scores-of-the-2017-Class-in-Summer-Semester

I made four plots to describe the distribution of the 2017 class's scores in summer semester.

The fist plot is *The_Distribution_of_Average_Scores_in_10_Classes* which is a bar chart to describe the average scores of 10 classes. It is conspicuous that Class 9 has the highest average scores among the 10 classes.

The second plot is *The_Distribution_of_Scores_in_10_Classes* which is a scatter chart to describe the score of every students in 10 classes. You can also find that almost every class has several students who get less than 30 except Class 9 and Class 10. The distribution of scores in Class 9 and Class 10 is absolutely different from 8 other classes.



The third plot is *The_Distribution_of_Top50_in_10_Classes*.



The forth plot is *The_Boxplot_of_the_Distribution_of_Scores_in_10_Classes*.



And the source code of plots and data analysis are in the *source_code.r* file.
